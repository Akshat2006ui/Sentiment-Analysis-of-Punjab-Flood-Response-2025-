## 🌊 Flood Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard
A Streamlit + NLP Project for Real-Time Public Sentiment Monitoring During Floods

## 📌 Overview

This project provides an interactive, real-time sentiment analysis dashboard for analyzing public emotions during flood situations using social media data.
It combines NLP, data visualization, and Streamlit UI to generate insights into how people react, respond, and communicate during flood emergencies.

The application automatically processes a dataset named flood_social_data.csv and visualizes sentiment, trends, locations, and more through a multi-tab dashboard.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

NLP: TextBlob

Frontend/UI: Streamlit

Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Preprocessing: Regex

## 🎯 Key Features
🔹 1. Automated Data Loading & Text Cleaning

✔ Loads flood_social_data.csv on startup
✔ Removes unwanted/blank columns
✔ Cleans:

URLs
Hashtags
Mentions
Emojis

Punctuation
✔ Handles missing values
✔ Creates derived columns (length, polarity, subjectivity, classification)

🔹 2. Advanced Sentiment Analysis

Uses TextBlob polarity + subjectivity to classify tweets into five categories:

## Polarity Range	Label

polarity > 0.20	Positive
0.05 < polarity ≤ 0.20	Slightly Positive
−0.05 ≤ polarity ≤ 0.05	Neutral
−0.20 ≤ polarity < −0.05	Slightly Negative
polarity < −0.20	Negative

## ⚠ Additional rule:
If subjectivity < 0.10, the post is automatically marked as Neutral.

🔹 3. Fully Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

The UI contains multiple analysis tabs:

🧪 Sentiment Classification Logic
polarity > 0.20                → Positive  
0.05 < polarity ≤ 0.20         → Slightly Positive  
−0.05 ≤ polarity ≤ 0.05        → Neutral  
−0.20 ≤ polarity < −0.05       → Slightly Negative  
polarity < −0.20               → Negative  

subjectivity < 0.10            → Neutral (override rule)
