🌊 Flood Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

A Streamlit + NLP Project for Analyzing Public Sentiment During Flood Situations

📌 Project Overview

This project provides an interactive, real-time sentiment analysis dashboard for flood-related social media data.
It uses:

TextBlob for sentiment polarity & subjectivity

Streamlit for UI and live visualization

Plotly for advanced interactive charts

Pandas/NumPy for data processing

Regex cleaning for preprocessing text

The application automatically loads a dataset named flood_social_data.csv and generates a fully interactive dashboard with multiple analysis tabs.
